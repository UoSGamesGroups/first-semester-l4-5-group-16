Occhiolism
The game character was a small child, travelling through a world thats was much bigger than him, caves, rooms and objects were massive in size to show how small the child perspective was.

Onism: 
And like the first explorers, sooner or later you have to contend with the blank spaces on the map. All the experiences you've never had. The part of you still aching to know what's out there. Eventually these questions take on a weight of their own, and begin looming over your everyday life.
The Awareness of How Little of the World You'll Experience, all the things you haven't done, all the risk you didnt take, all the destination you didn't go, things you are giving up to be here now.
A game feature is to give the player a choice of what direction to go but to block the other choices to get the player wondering what is in the other direction. Make the player play the game again to see the other location.
